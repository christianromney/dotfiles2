Structure
=========

This project contains my personal dotfiles collection. My primary machine is Mac OS X, but most of this stuff should work equally well under Linux (with a few alias exceptions). 

I use [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the symlinks in this repository, and the `homesync` script depends on it. To install it, 

     brew install stow
     
I run [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/), and [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto). iTerm2 is configured to use the [Source Code Pro for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro) font which allows me to use the [paradox](https://github.com/paradox460/prezto/blob/paradox/modules/prompt/functions/prompt_paradox_setup) prezto theme. My terminal color palette is set to [Smyck](http://color.smyck.org/).
