DESCRIPTION

      Remove a registered Trusted Tester component repository from the list of
      repositories used by the component manager. After removing a repository,
      you can run:

        $ gcloud components update to revert back to the standard version of any
      components that were installed from that repository.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [URL ...]

         Zero or more URLs for the component repositories you want to remove. If
         none are given, you will be prompted to choose which existing
         repository you want to remove.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To be prompted for registered Trusted Tester component repositories to
      remove run:
